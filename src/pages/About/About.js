            I have spent a significant portion of my career collaborating
            with foreign companies in the field of trade. Confronted with
            new technological solutions every day, I became increasingly
            fascinated by the development in the field of information technology.
            Acquiring essential skills in determination, resilience, and perseverance,
            coupled with my inclination to explore new facets of our daily lives
            and my love for exact sciences, in 2021, I decided to embark on the
            journey of learning web development.

            The decisive factor in choosing these technologies was the broad
            range of possibilities and prospects that open up for a developer
            when utilizing technologies such as:

            <span className="accented-text">JavaScript <br /> HTML<br /> CSS<br /> React<br /> TypeScript<br /></span>
          </div>
          <p className="about-text">
          Furthermore, the ability to immediately witness the results of my work
          and the opportunity to apply a certain level of creativity played a
          pivotal role. This is how I began my path as a Frontend developer.
          During my free time, away from studying and work, I enjoy traveling and
          discovering new places.
